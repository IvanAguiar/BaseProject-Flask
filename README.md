# Flask-base-project

In this project I'm providing to you a boilerplate for the most requirements you must have for APIs.

Following the patterns applied on this project, you'll be able to:

- Build a well-designed project;
- Provide a REST API, following the best practices available in th community;
- Authenticate your API using JWT
- Build a persistence way dynamically using SQLAlchemy;
- Configure environment variables for setup your project anywhere, using Dynaconf;
- Document your API using Swagger;
- Publish your application using Gunicon;
- Dockerize and deploy anywhere!

Enjoy!
